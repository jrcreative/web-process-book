# Web Process

Websites are complex and require mutliple disciplines to create effectively. There are the most obvious design and development aspects, but all of that is nothing without compelling content and&mdash;at the center it all&mdash;a valuable service, product or idea.

## Who is this book for?

This book attempts to lay out the entire process from beginning to end. If you're an agency with a web department, a client looking to hire someone to build your site, or an innovator with an idea, this book is for you.

For agencies, whether you're building a web department or fine-tuning your current one you know that building websites can be a profitable part of your business, or a huge time-suck depending on how well it's run. This book outlines a process for delivering quality work on time and at a profit! In many of my previous agency, that has felt like a pipe dream.

If you're looking to hire an agency, it will serve you well to understand what you're getting yourself into. Many of my clients have been caught off guard by the amount of work a website project is. This book will outline your role and the agencies role so you can come armed with realistic expectations for yourself and the agency you're partnering with.

If you want to go it alone and build a website that is awesome. It's a fun and satisfying endeavor, but it's also easy to get lost in it. One minute you're trying to get the columns to align, and the next you're trying to figure out if you even have 2 columns worth of stuff to say. Then you look on your phone and find that it's all squished and barely readable. Understanding the process and the order to address each stage will help you get organized and create a cohesive website that you can be proud of.

## Why is this important?

My goal is to break down each element and describe them in as much detail as possible. Some elements aren't needed at every project size, and some can be automated. I'll do my best to highlight those opportunities while also diving into their importance so which you can skip, save for later, or automate.
